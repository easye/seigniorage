Notes on the design
===================

The semantic description should be made in such a way that it
transcribes the futures of the necessary computation in a descriptive
(ala Prolog and successors like OWL2) rather than prescriptive manner.
In this sense, the idea is akin to the reactive programming movement,
but was not originally inspired by it  as such (insofar as both have
roots in Prolog.

The problem we aim to solve lies in how we trust code to mediate
relationships, with the application here being the Bitcoin blockchain.
