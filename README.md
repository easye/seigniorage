# Seigniorage

Transcribe Bitcoin represented in RDF to more than one executable
representation.


Model and implementation of distributed computations on Common Lisp
(CL) by verifiying the operation of the Bitcoin (BTC) network.

A formal semantic verification is sought that may optionally be
computed via a description of its futures.



## Verfication

Transcribe bitcoinj micro-transactions.

### Bitcoinj 0.12.3

The ASDF system enacapsulated in <file:bitcoinj.asd> needs locally
installed [bitcoinj][] Maven artifacts to work, as they are not
currently distributed over the global network.

[bitcoinj]: git+https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/

"Workers of the world, untie!"
